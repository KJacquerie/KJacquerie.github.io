## Teaching
During my PhD program, I was teaching assistant for the lecture [Introduction to signals and systems](https://www.programmes.uliege.be/cocoon/20232024/cours/SYST0002-2.html) at the University of Liege. 

I made a exercise booklet that students can use to have theoritical reminders and practise on some case studies. The french version of the booklet is available [here](https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/264163).

## Outside reasearch
- Funder of 'Pot'ingé'
Inaugurated in 2019, the Pot'Ingé project was initiated by a small group of doctoral students from the Faculty of Applied Sciences. The team quickly expanded, with around twenty members sharing their ideas and regularly tending to the plot located just steps away from B52. This collective project aims to raise awareness within the university community about biodiversity, local supply chains, and sustainability.
