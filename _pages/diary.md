## Outside academia
- **Funder of 'Pot'ingé'**

In 2019, I co-founded 'Pot'ingé,' a collaborative project initiated by doctoral students at the Faculty of Applied Sciences. Our aim was to promote biodiversity, local supply chains, and sustainability within the university community. We organized conferences and workshops to raise awareness on ecological issues. This initiative involved around thirty dedicated members, and we regularly tended to the plot near the engineering department. For more information, visit [here](https://potinge.be/fr-be/) or follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/potinge)  or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pot.inge/?hl=en).

This project stands as one of my most significant achievements, marking a pivotal turning point in my life. It served as a profound realization of the urgent need to overhaul our current lifestyle in response to climate change. 


- **'My Thesis in 180 seconds'**

I enthusiastically took part in the French-speaking contest 'My Thesis in 180 Seconds,' presenting my research in front of a non-specialist audience and a jury. Watch my presentation on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIfSuxalYPA).

I had one month of coaching, learning how to stand on a stage, how to speak clearly and popularize my research. It was a real challenge that I had enjoyed so much. 



## Academic engagements
- **Teaching Assistant in Computational Neursience Summer School**
In Summer 2021, I was a TA at the summer school 'Methods in Computational Neuroscience'. I spent one month in Woods Hole, MA, USA to supervise PhD or Postdoc summer projects. Additionnaly, I made workshops and panel discussion about diversity in neuroscience. 

-  **Teaching Assistant in Engineering**

During my PhD program at the University of Liege, I served as a teaching assistant for the course [Introduction to signals and systems](https://www.programmes.uliege.be/cocoon/20232024/cours/SYST0002-2.html). I created an exercise booklet designed to provide students with theoretical reminders and practical case studies. The French version of the booklet is accessible [here](https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/264163).

- **Master thesis supervision**

I supervised nine master students during their master thesis. They were working on my PhD project or some side-projects close to. It was an very inspiring experience. Their projects not only contributed to my research but also allowed me to enjoy supervising research projects and developing my teaching skills. It has encouraged
me to continue pursuing an academic career.


- **ENCODS 2023**: European Neuroscience Conference for Doctoral Students

As a selected member of the organizing committee by FENS (Federation of European Neuroscience Societies), I contributed to planning and executing a 2-day conference involving 10 PhD worldwide candidates and Postdocs. This experience offered valuable insights into conference management, including speaker selection, workshop creation, venue preparation, budget management, sponsor acquisition, and more.


- **Belgian Society for Neuroscience (BSN)**: Junior Board Membership 

Representing my university, I joined the Junior Board aimed at fostering connections among young neuroscientists in Belgium. Additionally, I played a role in organizing the annual neuroscience meeting in Belgium.
   

- **Representative - Doctoral Office at the University of Liege**

Representing the Science & Technology sector, I actively contributed to shaping rules and regulations for all PhD candidates at the University of Liege. I wanted to have an impact inside my university to improve the condition of PhD candidates. 


- **Manager - PhD Network at University of Liege (ReD)**

As the project manager from 2020 to 2021 and previously as the community manager from 2019 to 2020, I led initiatives within the [ReD](https://www.red.uliege.be), focusing on diverse areas such as ecology, solidarity, and gender equality. I facilitated the establishment of working groups to implement various initiatives while managing social networks and organizing events.
