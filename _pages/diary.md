## TEACHING
During my PhD program, I was teaching assistant for the lecture [Introduction to signals and systems](https://www.programmes.uliege.be/cocoon/20232024/cours/SYST0002-2.html) at the University of Liege. 

I made a exercise booklet that students can use to have theoritical reminders and practise on some case studies. 
The french version of the booklet is available [here](https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/264163).
