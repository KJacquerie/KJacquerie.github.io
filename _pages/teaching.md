During my PhD program, I was teaching assistant for the lecture ["Introduction to signals and systems"]{https://www.programmes.uliege.be/cocoon/20232024/cours/SYST0002-2.html} at the University of Liege. 

I made a exercise booklet that students can use to have theoritical reminders and practise on some case studies. 
The french version of the booklet is available [here]{https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/264163}.
