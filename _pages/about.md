I am a PhD candidate in computational neuroscience under the supervision of [Guillaume Drion](https://sites.google.com/site/gdrion25/) at the [University of Liège](https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_8699436/en/uliege) in Belgium. I am interested in uncovering the molecular and cellular mechanisms of reliable neuromodulation in highly heterogenous neurons, from the point of view of dynamical systems. To do so, I mainly use conductance-based models. Previously, I gratuated biomedical engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) in 2021.
