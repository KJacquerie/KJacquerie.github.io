Welcome to my research journey!

I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Eve Marder's Lab](https://blogs.brandeis.edu/marderlab/) in Boston. I am interested in the effects of changing ecosystems on the nervous systems. 

I did my PhD in computational neuroscience under the supervision of [Guillaume Drion](https://sites.google.com/site/gdrion25/). I investigated how rest periods affect our memory consolidation. I built biophysical neurons able to switch from learning to resting phase, corresponding to a switch from tonic to burst firing, and studied the evolution of the synaptic weights. I proposed a mechanism for burst-driven late-phase plasticity.
